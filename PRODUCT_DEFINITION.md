# ShiftPro - Target Audience and Primary Jobs-To-Be-Done

## Product Promise
ShiftPro helps shift workers plan, track, and get paid accurately by turning complex schedules into clear next steps and reliable time/pay summaries.

## Target Audience
### Primary Users
- Individual shift workers with rotating or irregular schedules who need a personal, on-device planner.
- Examples: nurses, EMTs, hospitality staff, manufacturing operators, retail supervisors, security staff.

### Secondary Users
- Fixed-schedule hourly workers who still need overtime tracking and calendar sync.
- Shift workers who coordinate across multiple jobs or locations.

### Non-Goals
- Team scheduling or manager rostering (no multi-user roster management).
- Enterprise payroll processing; exports only support personal use and payroll handoff.

## Primary Jobs-To-Be-Done
1) **Know what is next and when**
   - Outcome: A quick, glanceable dashboard that answers "When is my next shift?" and "Am I on now?"

2) **Capture shifts fast without friction**
   - Outcome: Create or adjust a shift in under a minute; support both ad-hoc and pattern-based schedules.

3) **Track hours and pay with confidence**
   - Outcome: Accurate paid hours and premium rate totals by pay period, with clear breakdowns.

4) **Keep the rest of life in sync**
   - Outcome: Optional, reliable two-way calendar sync and timely notifications.

5) **Handle recurring patterns without manual re-entry**
   - Outcome: Rotating pattern setup and preview that generates shifts automatically.

6) **Export and back up data**
   - Outcome: Simple exports (CSV/ICS/PDF/JSON) to share with payroll or move devices.

## Key UX Principles
- **One-tap next action**: Start shift, end shift, or add shift should be accessible immediately.
- **Contextual clarity**: Show what matters for today and this pay period first.
- **Progressive detail**: Drill-in for notes, rate multipliers, and break details only when needed.
- **Trust and accuracy**: Explicit validations, conflict detection, and clear error states.
- **Neutral terminology**: Avoid law-enforcement-specific copy unless explicitly configured.

## Tone and Terminology
- Use broad, role-neutral language ("Shift," "Worksite," "Role") instead of "Precinct," "Badge," "Officer."
- Keep labels short and skimmable for on-the-job use.

## Success Signals
- Users can complete onboarding and see personalized data on first launch.
- Core flows (add/edit shift, view schedule, start/end shift, view pay period) work end-to-end without placeholders.
- Calendar sync and notifications are transparent, optional, and reliable.
