Custom Patterns - User-defined irregular patterns\n4. Holiday Overrides - Special scheduling for holidays/events\n\nROTATION CYCLE EXAMPLES:\n- 4-on-4-off: 4 consecutive work days, 4 days off, repeat\n- DuPont: 12-hour shifts, complex 4-week rotation\n- 2-2-3-2-2-3: Continental shift pattern popular in manufacturing\n- Pitman: 14-day cycle alternating day/night shifts\n\nTECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Pattern generator using date mathematics\n- Template system for common police schedules\n- Conflict detection and resolution\n- Preview generation (1-6 month outlook)\n- Pattern validation against business rules\n\nPATTERN EDITOR FEATURES:\n- Visual calendar builder for weekly patterns\n- Cycle definition wizard for rotations\n- Pattern preview with generated shifts\n- Template library with police-specific patterns\n- Pattern sharing/export between users\n\nGENERATION ALGORITHM:\n- Start date + cycle definition = infinite shift sequence\n- Efficient generation (only calculate needed date ranges)\n- Handle edge cases: leap years, month boundaries, DST\n- Pattern modification without losing historical shifts\n\nFILES TO CREATE:\n- /ShiftPro/Services/PatternEngine.swift - Core generation logic\n- /ShiftPro/Services/PatternTemplates.swift - Pre-built patterns\n- /ShiftPro/Models/PatternDefinition.swift - Pattern data structures\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Patterns/PatternEditorView.swift - Creation interface\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Patterns/PatternPreviewView.swift - Visual preview\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Patterns/PatternLibraryView.swift - Template browser\n- /ShiftPro/Utils/DateMath.swift - Date calculation utilities\n\nPATTERN VALIDATION:\n- Maximum shift duration (e.g., 24 hours)\n- Minimum rest between shifts (e.g., 8 hours)\n- Weekly/monthly hour limits\n- Consecutive day limits\n- Pattern consistency checks\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- All common police patterns can be created\n- Pattern generation handles 5+ years accurately\n- Visual preview shows correct shift placement\n- Performance: \u003c1s to generate 6 months of shifts\n- Patterns export/import correctly\n- Business rule validation prevents invalid patterns\n\nESTIMATED EFFORT: 14-18 hours\nBLOCKERS: Requires Phase 1 foundation\n\nREASONING: Pattern flexibility essential for different police departments.

Welcome \u0026 Permission Pre-flight - Explain what permissions are needed and why\n2. Profile Setup - Badge number, department, rank, start date (optional fields)\n3. Pay Period Configuration - Weekly/bi-weekly/monthly, regular hours\n4. Shift Pattern Discovery - Common patterns for their role, or create custom\n5. Calendar Integration - Optional setup with explanation of benefits\n6. First Shift Creation - Guided creation with preview\n7. TipKit Intro - Contextual hints for main features\n\nPERMISSION STRATEGY:\n- Pre-flight explanations before requesting\n- Graceful degradation if permissions denied\n- Re-request flow for users who change their mind\n- Settings deep links for permission changes\n\nUSER PROFILE FEATURES:\n- Badge number validation (optional, department-specific)\n- Department/rank selection from common presets\n- Pay rate setup (optional, for calculations)\n- Work schedule preferences\n- Notification preferences\n\nSMART DEFAULTS:\n- Police-specific shift patterns (8-hour, 12-hour, 4-on-4-off)\n- Common break durations (30 minutes)\n- Standard overtime rules (1.5x after 8 hours)\n- Bi-weekly pay periods as default\n\nFILES TO CREATE:\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Onboarding/WelcomeView.swift - Welcome screen\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Onboarding/PermissionsView.swift - Permission requests\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Onboarding/ProfileSetupView.swift - User info\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Onboarding/PayPeriodSetupView.swift - Pay configuration\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Onboarding/PatternDiscoveryView.swift - Shift pattern setup\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Onboarding/CalendarSetupView.swift - Calendar integration\n- /ShiftPro/Views/Onboarding/CompletionView.swift - Onboarding complete\n- /ShiftPro/Services/OnboardingManager.swift - Flow coordination\n- /ShiftPro/Utils/PermissionManager.swift - Permission handling\n\nTIPKIT INTEGRATION:\n- Contextual tips for first-time actions\n- Progressive disclosure of advanced features\n- Tip dismissal tracking\n- Smart tip prioritization based on usage\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- Complete onboarding flow works end-to-end\n- User can skip optional steps gracefully\n- Permissions requests are clear and justified\n- Profile information saves correctly\n- Smart defaults work for common scenarios\n- TipKit hints appear contextually\n\nESTIMATED EFFORT: 10-12 hours\nBLOCKERS: Requires basic UI components\n\nREASONING: First impression critical for police officers who value efficiency.
